    <p>
      In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
      It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some 
      fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
      The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

    <div id="line4">Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</div>

    <div id="line6">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</div>
    <div id="line7">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</div>
    <div id="line8">The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:</div>
